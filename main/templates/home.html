    <h1>{{ request.site.name }}</h1>
    <p class="lead">Have fun with spam!</p>
</div>

<h2>What is {{ request.site.name }}?</h2>
<p>{{ request.site.name }} is a way to waste spammers' time. If you get a spam
email, simply forward it to <a href="mailto:sp@mnesty.com">sp@mnesty.com</a>,
and {{ request.site.name }} will strip anything that has to do with you, pretend
it's a real person and reply to the email.</p>

<p>That way, the spammer will start talking to a bot, and hopefully waste some
time there instead of spending it on a real victim. Meanwhile,
{{ request.site.name }} will send you an email with a link to the conversation,
so you can watch it unfold live!</p>

<p>
<strong>WARNING:</strong> The service isn't done yet, so if you forward an
email to it, it will just reply to you. It's good data for me to test the
service, so do it if you want, but it'll only start working in a few days.
Thanks for your help!
