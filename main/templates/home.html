</div>

<h2>What is {{ request.site.name }}?</h2>
<p>{{ request.site.name }} is a way to waste spammers' time. If you get a spam
email, simply forward it to <a href="mailto:sp@mnesty.com">sp@mnesty.com</a>,
and {{ request.site.name }} will strip your email address, pretend it's a real
person and reply to the email.</p>

<p>That way, the spammer will start talking to a bot, and hopefully waste some
time there instead of spending it on a real victim. Meanwhile,
{{ request.site.name }} will send you an email with a link to the conversation,
so you can watch it unfold live!</p>

<h3>Current state</h3>

<strong>WARNING:</strong> The service isn't done yet! It looks like crap and
there may be loads of wonky stuff going on. That said, you can help by
cautiously using it for a bit, and

if you notice something wrong or if you have any suggestions.

Thanks for your help!
