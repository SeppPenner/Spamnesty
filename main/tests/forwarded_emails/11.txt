Dear,

Do your password reset requests tend to 'spike' in January, after the Christmas break?

Install our reset password application: now, free of charge until the end of January. You’ll be amazed at the drop in the number of password reset calls and the amount of time you free up for your service desk.

The ‘Forgot My Password’ button is integrated seamlessly into the Windows logon screen so there’s no need to call or submit a support ticket. Fewer password reset related calls to the IT helpdesk equals more productive time for your team.

If you'd like to know more about how this can work for - or arrange a complimentary trial - either give me a call on the number below.

Regards,
